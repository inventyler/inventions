Where the wild things are and the dreams run free

//December 30, 2015
This is the start of an Invention. A long journey ahead of me awaits but through time and hard work will come a great product of my creation. A lot is to be learned and there is no better time then now.

As 2015 comes to a close, I will ambitiously strive to acheive my goals for 2016 and beyond. The programs and codes I write will start off basic but will progressly become more complex. 

What a time to be alive.
